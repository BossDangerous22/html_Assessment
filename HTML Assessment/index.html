        <p>During the pandemic, my focus was in gaining new skills and making money online. I found a new side hustle gig doing user testing online which was a life saver honestly. I work for myself as doing wordpress website maintinance in betweeen projects I get for creating or redesigning websites for entreprenuers and small business owners while I focus on my studies.</p>
